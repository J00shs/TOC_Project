Snake game for Theory of Comp :)

<h1>Documentation</h1>
<h2>JFrame V. JPanel</h2>
<p>In the project, you'll come across "JPanel" and "JFrame". These are two libraries that allow Java to develop applications such as our 
own beautiful Snake Game. </p>
<p></p>
<p>JFrame is class that allows us to build the WINDOW of the application. We can set various properties such as the size, the title, and
whether or not the window is visible to the user. We can also tell a JFrame object what will happen if when the user clicks the close button.</p>
<p></p>
<p>JPanel, on the other hand, is a class that builds the CONTENT of the application. If you refer to the "MenuPane" class of our wonderful code,
you will see that the class itself extends JPanel. JPanel gives us the ability to add various COMPONENTS such as buttons and text labels. We can use 
a LAYOUT MANAGER in order to position things in aesthetically pleasing way. In this project, we used the "GridBagLayout" manager.
